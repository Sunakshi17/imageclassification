# imageclassification
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal is to develop a CNN model that can accurately classify these images into their respective categories.

Code Overview

Loading the Dataset: The script starts by importing necessary libraries and loading the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow's datasets.cifar10.load_data() function. It separates the data into training and testing sets, and reshapes the labels for further processing.

Observing the Dataset: A function called showImage() is defined to visualize images from the dataset along with their corresponding labels.

Data Preprocessing: The images are normalized by dividing their pixel values by 255 to bring them into the range [0, 1], which helps improve training efficiency.

Building the CNN Model: The script defines a Sequential model using TensorFlow Keras. It adds two convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max-pooling, followed by a flatten layer, and two fully connected layers with ReLU and softmax activations, respectively.

Compiling the Model: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss. The accuracy metric is also specified.

Training the Model: The model is trained using the training data and validated using the testing data for a specified number of epochs.

Making Predictions: After training, the model is used to make predictions on the testing data. The predicted labels are converted to class indices.

Model Evaluation: The script evaluates the model's performance by calculating accuracy and generating a classification report. Additionally, a confusion matrix is generated and visualized using a heatmap.

How to Use:-

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have the required libraries installed (TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn).
Run the script cifar10_classification.py.
The script will train the CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset and display the training progress and evaluation results.
You can modify the script's hyperparameters, architecture, or other settings to experiment and improve the model's performance.
